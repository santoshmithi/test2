We’re updating our Employee Data API to improve performance and usability. Below are the key changes:

New GraphQL Endpoint
Endpoint: POST /graphql/latestEmployee
Features:
✅ Pagination: Fetch data in pages (pagesize=10, pagenumber increments until null).
✅ Basic Filtering: Supports indexsymbol (max 10 symbols per request).
⚠ Limitations:

No WHERE clause support.

No total record count (loop until empty response).

Old REST Endpoint (Deprecated)
Endpoint: GET /api/employees
Features:
✅ Supports GraphQL-style WHERE conditions for complex filtering.
⚠ Limitations:

Known performance issues with large datasets (e.g., currency exposure).

Action Items:
For simple queries: Migrate to the new GraphQL endpoint.

For complex WHERE clauses: Continue using the old endpoint (optimizations coming soon).
